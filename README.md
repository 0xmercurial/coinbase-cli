# Coinbase CLI

The Coinbase CLI (`cbcli`) is a CLI for interfacing with the Coinbase API

---

## Getting Started
It's super easy to get started with the `cbcli`:
### 1. Make sure you have Go installed 
```zsh
#find out if you have Go already installed
$ go version

#if an error is thrown, go here to download: https://go.dev/doc/install 
```

### 2. Clone the repo
```zsh
$ git clone git@github.com:0xmercurial/coinbase-cli.git

$ cd coinbase-cli/ #or just `coinbase-cli` if using zsh

$ git pull #only one branch at this time
```

### 3. Make the executable
```zsh
# this will build the binary into this path within the project: 
# /bin/cbcli
make build

```
Now we can get started with `cbcli` !
